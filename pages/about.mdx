### To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to highly recommend Sahil Ashok Sawant for consideration in the Long Term Visiting Students Program and S. N. Bhatt Memorial Excellence Fellowship Program offered by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS). Sahil has been an outstanding student during his tenure at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, where I am the Dean of Analytics.

As the Dean of Analytics, and his mentor in Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, I have had the privilege of witnessing Sahil's exceptional dedication, academic talents, and passion for interdisciplinary studies, particularly in the fields of Electronics, Telecommunications Engineering, Physics and Astronomy. Also, his efforts are justified by his grasp of concept and inclusiveness to share and enrich knowledge places him in my top 10% students whom I have mentored.

Sahil's academic journey at the institution has been marked by a series of remarkable accomplishments and projects. Notably, his involvement in projects such as the Analysis of 3.5m Radio Telescope, Horn Antenna Workshop (at IUCAA), and Optical Stellar Telescope Automation reflect his adeptness in merging theoretical knowledge with practical applications in the realms of engineering and astrophysics.

His active participation and leadership roles within the Antariksh Astronomy Club, coupled with his engagement in various volunteering activities, highlight his commitment to sharing knowledge and nurturing a passion for astronomy among his peers. Also, his commitment to his studies have placed him for Internship at BMC-Softwares in his 5th academic semester (CGPA=8.47).

Sahil and his expressed interest in participating in the Long Term Visiting Students Program and the S. N. Bhatt Memorial Excellence Fellowship Program at esteemed institution such as TIFR and ICTS aligns perfectly with his quest for advanced learning, interdisciplinary exploration, and a deeper understanding of astrophysical research.

I have no doubt that Sahil Ashok Sawant's dedication, inquisitiveness, and multidisciplinary approach make him an ideal candidate for these prestigious programs. His enthusiasm for merging engineering principles with astrophysics and his track record of excellence undoubtedly make him a valuable addition to any program he chooses to pursue.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you require any further information regarding Sahil or his academic achievements.

Thank you for considering Sahil Ashok Sawant for these esteemed programs.
