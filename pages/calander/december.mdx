# DECEMBER' 23

## December 13, 14: Geminids Meteor Shower 2023: Lunar-Lit Spectacle

The anticipated 2024 Geminid meteor shower, peaking on December 13, promises a celestial display despite the challenge posed by a bright waxing gibbous moon. Originating near the Gemini constellation's Castor star, these radiant meteors will illuminate the eastern skies on December evenings. Although the moon's luminance might hinder visibility, the Geminids, renowned for their brightness, could still offer a captivating show. Lasting from November 19 to December 24, this shower typically boasts up to 120 meteors per hour under optimal conditions. The Geminids, distinct from comet-induced showers, derive from the asteroid 3200 Phaethon's intersection with Earth's orbit. Despite lunar interference, stargazers might catch these luminous streaks by finding a dark sky and patiently awaiting this cosmic spectacle.

## December 14: Sun Releases Strong Solar Flare


Solar flares represent potent surges of energy, exerting influence on radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and introducing potential hazards to spacecraft and astronauts.
This particular flare has been categorized as an X2.8 flare. The classification of X-class denotes the highest level of intensity among flares, with the accompanying number offering further insights into its strength.

For a comprehensive understanding of how such space weather might impact Earth, you are encouraged to explore the NOAAâ€™s Space Weather Prediction Center at [spaceweather](https://spaceweather.gov/). This center serves as the official U.S. government source for space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, and alerts. NASA plays a crucial role in advancing space weather research, maintaining constant surveillance of the Sun and our surrounding space environment through a fleet of spacecraft. These spacecraft diligently study various aspects, ranging from the Sun's activity and the solar atmosphere to particles and magnetic fields in the space surrounding Earth.

## December 15: Binary Stars Stripped of Hydrogen Unveil Cosmic Secrets

A groundbreaking discovery by University of Toronto astronomers reveals a population of massive stars stripped of their hydrogen envelopes by binary companions. This finding, detailed in Science, sheds light on hot helium stars linked to hydrogen-poor core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Previously theorized but elusive, these stars' confirmation marks a significant leap in understanding cosmic phenomena. Co-lead author Maria Drout emphasized the implications, highlighting the impact on supernovae theories, gravitational wave studies, and distant galaxy observations. Identified through ultraviolet observations and theoretical models, these stars offer a new avenue for exploring their properties, crucial for predicting events like neutron star mergers. This discovery underscores the intricate relationships between celestial bodies, expanding our cosmic comprehension.
