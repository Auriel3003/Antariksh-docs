Pulsar glitch phenomena present unique insights into the dynamics of neutron stars, marking pivotal events of sudden rotational changes. This study delves into the advancements in glitch monitoring facilitated by state-of-the-art telescopes, with a focus on the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and precursor instruments such as the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). Leveraging experiences and insights from ongoing research, this work outlines optimized observation strategies, real-time glitch detection methodologies, and robust analysis pipelines. The culmination of these developments sets the stage for a transformative era in pulsar glitch studies, promising unprecedented precision in understanding neutron star physics in the forthcoming SKA era.

## Introduction :
Pulsar glitches, enigmatic and abrupt shifts in the rotational behavior of neutron stars, stand as captivating cosmic phenomena that unravel the intricate dynamics within these stellar remnants. As our understanding of these glitches deepens, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) emerges as a promising frontier, poised to revolutionize the study of pulsar timing irregularities.
The scientific community's pursuit of unraveling the mystery behind pulsar glitches has seen significant strides, prominently aided by observations and analyses conducted with precursor instruments like the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). These pathfinders have not only unveiled a diverse array of glitches but have also laid the groundwork for strategies and methodologies that will shape glitch monitoring programs with the SKA.
Through meticulous observations and in-depth analyses, researchers have unveiled the peculiarities of glitches - sudden accelerations in rotational frequency followed by post-glitch recovery - presenting tantalizing puzzles within the realm of neutron star physics. The imminent arrival of the SKA promises to amplify our capacity to scrutinize these glitches, with estimates suggesting a substantial increase in the known pulsar population. This proliferation in observed pulsars, projected to reach around 14,000 normal pulsars and 6,000 millisecond pulsars, will significantly augment the sample size for glitch investigations compared to the current count of approximately 3,300 known pulsars (as per the ATNF pulsar catalog).
Leveraging insights from precursor telescopes, scientists are poised to optimize observation strategies using the SKA. These strategies, developed based on experiences garnered from observing pulsars with different dispersion measures and across multiple frequency bands, are expected to enhance signal detection efficiency and reduce timing uncertainties. This optimization will be critical in unveiling glitch occurrences and understanding their underlying physics with unprecedented precision.
Moreover, the potential of real-time glitch detection techniques, a capability endowed by the SKA's beamformer and central signal processing, promises a paradigm shift in glitch monitoring. This real-time detection, akin to transient event triggers, heralds high-cadence post-glitch recovery observations in a target-of-opportunity mode. Such observations, limited in the past, are poised to play a pivotal role in unraveling the intricacies of glitch recovery physics.
As construction progresses on the SKA Phase I telescope, experiences garnered from the uGMRT and ORT are pivotal. They pave the way for glitch studies, envisioning optimized observing strategies and real-time detection methodologies, underscoring the community's readiness for the impending era of pulsar glitch investigations. The journey from precursor telescopes to the SKA epitomizes a continuum of scientific progress, offering glimpses into the promising future of understanding pulsar glitches and neutron star dynamics.

## Observation Strategies and Telescope Capabilities:
**Leveraging Telescope Features for Optimal Observation:**
The efficacy of glitch monitoring heavily relies on tailored observation strategies aligning with the capabilities of cutting-edge telescopes. Precursor instruments like the uGMRT and ORT have demonstrated the significance of multi-band observations, harnessing a broad frequency range and phased-array capabilities. These telescopes, resembling facets of the forthcoming SKA, have underscored the advantage of diverse frequency bands and sub-array configurations. Observing strategies optimized based on dispersion measure (DM) considerations have been pivotal, as evidenced by segregating observations at distinct frequency bands corresponding to varying DM ranges. For instance, lower DM pulsars were observed at lower frequencies to counter pulse scatter-broadening effects, thereby ensuring enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, the steep spectra of these pulsars necessitate shorter integration times, further refining observing schedules.
**SKA Advancements and Optimized Programs:**
With the SKA's impending arrival, lessons from precursor programs serve as guiding principles for the design of glitch monitoring initiatives. The SKA's potential, especially with its multiple sub-arrays and bands, encourages the development of refined observation programs. The prospect of using 16 beams in the SKA-mid and SKA-low telescopes, coupled with versatile antenna combinations, presents an opportunity for an optimized program based on the successes observed with precursor telescopes. Strategies are under evaluation to exploit these features, with the intent to expand the sample size of observed pulsars and enhance monitoring cadence, critical for understanding glitch behavior.

## Real-time Glitch Detection and Analysis Pipelines:
**Automation and Real-time Triggering Mechanisms:**
Pioneering efforts in real-time glitch detection, exemplified by the pipeline at ORT generating email triggers for potential glitches, have set the stage for innovative methodologies. These pipelines, with rapid triggers and subsequent target of opportunity requests, ensure high-cadence observations following glitch events. Akin to this, the development of an offline analysis pipeline for precise timing at uGMRT serves as a precursor to the SKA's real-time data processing requirements. Efforts are underway to integrate similar real-time pipelines into the SKA's science data processor, paralleling transient event triggers and initiating follow-up high-cadence observations, crucial for capturing nuanced glitch recoveries.

## Community Engagement and Future Prospects:
**Building the SKA User Community:**
The glitch monitoring programs with uGMRT and ORT have played a pivotal role in fostering community engagement within the Indian NS (Neutron Star) community. These initiatives have facilitated a connection between astronomers and astrophysicists, providing a platform for collaboration between observational and theoretical expertise. The successful training of three doctoral students in this field and the ongoing study using MeerKAT, known as the thousand pulsar array program, underscore the impact of these programs on community building. These endeavors have stimulated theoretical explorations into the equation of state and internal structure of NS, laying the groundwork for future interpretations of data in the SKA era.
**Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer:**
As the SKA's construction progresses, the accumulated knowledge from glitch monitoring programs stands as a testament to effective capacity building. The skilled manpower developed over the past five years is poised to contribute significantly to the scientific utilization of the SKA telescope. The program's success in connecting astronomers and motivating theoretical explorations indicates a positive trend in building a robust and knowledgeable SKA user community. The knowledge transfer from precursor programs will be instrumental in optimizing glitch monitoring programs for the pulsar key science project during the SKA's Phase I telescope operations.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the scientific research conducted through glitch monitoring programs with uGMRT and ORT not only contributes valuable data on pulsar glitches but also serves as a blueprint for the future SKA era. The success of these programs in detecting glitches, characterizing post-glitch behavior, and understanding timing noise parameters provides a solid foundation for the upcoming challenges with the SKA telescope. The combination of optimized observation strategies, real-time glitch detection pipelines, and community engagement initiatives positions the SKA as a transformative force in radio astronomy, promising a wealth of insights into the intricacies of neutron stars and their irregularities. As the SKA becomes operational in approximately four years, the groundwork laid by these programs will propel the scientific community into an era of unprecedented discoveries and advancements.
