## Section 1: Probing GRSs and Relics
The exploration of Giant Radio Sources (GRSs) and their intriguing connection to relics in the cosmic landscape stands as a cornerstone in contemporary astrophysical investigations. Recent strides in observational capabilities, especially through instruments like LOFAR, ASKAP, and MeerKAT, have provided a robust platform for scrutinizing these cosmic giants and their correlations with relics, shedding light on their entangled narrative.
**Observational Advancements:**
Advances in radio astronomy have unveiled a compelling relationship between GRSs and relics. These Giant Radio Sources, spanning hundreds of kiloparsecs, present an ideal canvas for relic investigations due to their vast coverage. Studies, including notable instances like Abell 3411-3412 and A3376, have revealed empirical connections between radio galaxies and relics, underscoring how these celestial behemoths serve as reservoirs for the ancient electron population necessary for relic formation.
**Unraveling the Mysteries:**
However, the full spectrum of electron population re-acceleration processes requisite for generating massive shock relics within GRSs remains under active exploration. The scale and coverage of GRSs, owing to their enormous sizes, make them prime candidates for such investigations. Understanding the mechanisms by which these structures supply fossil electrons essential for the creation of radio relics remains a tantalizing frontier in modern astrophysics.

## Section 2: Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect
**Altering CMB Spectra:**
The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, a consequence of inverse Compton scattering between non-thermal electron populations and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, manifests as a spectral shift in the CMB. The elevation of CMB photons to higher energies through this process creates a distinctive signature observed in radio surveys.
**Altering CMB Spectra:**
Studies leveraging GRSs and Relativistic Sources (RSs) have endeavored to explore the SZ effect. Research by Yamada et al., Colafrancesco & Marchegiani, and Colafrancesco et al. has delved into the potential impact of GRSs on anisotropies within the CMB. However, suggestions by Blundell et al. and Erlund et al., building upon Enßlin & Kaiser's work, postulate that GRSs, given their substantial sizes akin to galaxy clusters, might significantly contribute to contaminating SZ surveys.

### Section 3: Accelerating Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays

Giant Radio Galaxies (GRGs) emerge as promising candidates for harboring sites conducive to the acceleration of Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). Their expansive lobe sizes, spanning hundreds of kiloparsecs, coupled with ongoing turbulent activities in their hotspots, present an environment conducive to accelerating charged particles to exceedingly high energies, ranging between ∼10^18 to 10^21 electron volts.
**Investigating Acceleration Mechanisms:**
Semi-analytical models, including works by Blandford, Fraschetti & Melia, and Matthews, have proposed jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) as potential origins for UHECRs. These models highlight the role of shocks within energetic jets and lobes in propelling particles to such extreme energies. Notably, studies by Hardcastle and associates, illustrating Figure 1 in Hardcastle (2010), emphasize the propensity of large-sized RGs or GRGs to serve as plausible sites for the acceleration of UHECRs.
**Association with Particle Emission:**
The association of GRGs with efficient particle acceleration was initially expounded upon by Kronberg et al., leveraging theories of collisionless magnetic reconnection. Later works by Hardcastle et al. and O’Sullivan et al. reinforced this notion, particularly regarding Centaurus A. The multifaceted involvement of GRGs in the high-energy particle domain gains additional credence from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory's reports on neutrino emissions from blazar TXS 0506+056.

### Section 4: Formation and Characteristics
**Enigmatic Formation Mechanisms:**
Understanding the genesis of these colossal structures remains a paramount challenge. Theoretical explorations and empirical studies examining the dynamical and spectral age of GRSs and Smaller Radio Sources (SRSs) portray GRSs as significantly older systems, with ages reaching several times 10^8 years. However, the precise factors fostering the formation of GRSs remain elusive.
**Environment and AGN Influence:**
The spatial distribution of GRSs in the P–D diagram and their occurrences within low-density environments or galaxy cluster centers, as demonstrated by studies like Komberg & Pashchenko, Dabhade et al., and Tang et al., unveils nuanced aspects of their habitat. Contrary to previous assumptions, GRSs do not exclusively dwell in sparse environments. Observational evidence suggests asymmetries in gas distribution surrounding these sources, potentially influencing their growth and size.
**AGN Power and Recurrence:**
Contrary to assumptions regarding extremely powerful AGNs driving GRS expansion, empirical findings exhibit a wide range of jet powers among GRSs. Studies by Ishwara-Chandra & Saikia highlight similarities in core strength between GRGs and smaller-sized sources, implying that a more potent AGN isn't a defining characteristic of GRGs. Recurrent nuclear jet activity, although speculated to contribute to GRS growth, is exhibited in only a fraction of these sources.

## Section 5: Future Prospects with SKA
**Expanding Observational Horizons:**
The advent of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) heralds an era of unprecedented discovery and insight into Giant Radio Galaxies (GRGs). The SKA's high sensitivity and superior resolution, particularly at low radio frequencies, promise a quantum leap in our understanding of these colossal structures.
** Surveys and Population Studies:**
Anticipated surveys with the SKA are poised to dramatically increase the known population of GRGs. Insights gleaned from recent surveys with LOFAR and ASKAP, as highlighted by Dabhade et al., Andernach et al., and Oei et al., underscore the potential for a significant expansion in the number of identified GRGs upon SKA's deployment.
**Addressing Key Questions:**
The SKA's capabilities are poised to shed light on several unresolved facets of GRGs. It holds the promise of discerning fainter GRSs and detecting minute surface brightness features associated with radio sources or GRSs, as evidenced by recent deep observations with LOFAR and MeerKAT. Moreover, its potential to identify high-redshift (z > 3) GRSs will allow researchers to explore their evolution in high-density environments and probe their interactions via the Inverse Compton (IC) process with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
** Investigating GRG Dynamics:**
Beyond mere identification, the SKA's high sensitivity will facilitate the detection of recurrent activities even in weaker sources, enabling a deeper understanding of their impact on host galaxies and overall galactic evolution. Moreover, the SKA will significantly contribute to studying the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and its implications on addressing the 'missing baryons' problem through the probing capabilities of GRGs.

The paper's research journey encapsulates a comprehensive exploration of Giant Radio Galaxies (GRGs), offering substantial advancements in understanding these enigmatic cosmic entities. However, despite strides in empirical observations and theoretical models, fundamental questions regarding GRG formation, their diverse characteristics, and their roles as cosmic accelerators remain elusive.
**SKA: A Gateway to Novel Insights:**
The imminent arrival of the SKA emerges as a beacon of hope, promising a leap forward in unraveling the mysteries surrounding GRGs. Its advanced capabilities in radio astronomy are poised to substantially augment our understanding of GRGs, unveiling hitherto unseen phenomena, and potentially revolutionizing our comprehension of large-scale structures in the universe.
**Embracing Future Explorations:**
As researchers eagerly await the SKA's deployment, the anticipation of an expanded GRG census, deeper insights into their dynamics, and the revelation of high-redshift phenomena impels the scientific community towards a future replete with possibilities. The SKA stands as a catalyst for propelling GRG research into uncharted territories, offering a telescope to peer into the depths of cosmic evolution and structure.
