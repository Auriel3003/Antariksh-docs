# Antariksh Club

Antariksh Club, also known as Antariksh Astronomy Club, is an inter-institutional club operating under the umbrella of Vishwakarma Institutes (including Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, and Vishwakarma University), was founded in 2009 by three visionaries: Raunak, Abhishek, and alumnus Jameer sir. With a rich legacy, Antariksh Members have nurtured countless successful careers in Research globally, with alumni contributing to esteemed organisations such as ISRO, IUCAA, IISERs, and prestigious institutions abroad. Our primary agenda is Research and Sharing of Knowledge.
